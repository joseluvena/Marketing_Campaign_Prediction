# Marketing_Campaign_Prediction
This project uses a marketing campaign data to predict if a customer is likely to respond to the newest marketing campaign.
The variables are mostly demographic variables and campaign response history.
The project uses Python as its analytic tools, with some packages:
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

The project includes:
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization
- Machine learning

Through the analysis, we want to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict customers that is likely to respond to a marketing campaign, so that the company can focus its targetting to these people.
